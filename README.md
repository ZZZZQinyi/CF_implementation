# DSCI552_FinalProject
This project is about recommendation algorithm based on Collaborative Filtering algorithm

I have something to say about my implementation.
Thanks to author echen who share the implemented RBM CF algorithm on the github. And I also want to thanks to Chaoyang Zhang.
They help me implement RBM CF. I rewrite the implementation method through my understanding.
I also modified some places in order to make it easier for me to understand.
As for SVD algorithm, I want to thanks to â€ªYehuda Koren. He has gave a very detailed introduction to this algorithm, I just copied his ideas.

For the implementation of this project, I did not spend a lot of energy, because of limited time and energy. Many implementation details are not perfect. 
But this is my first contact with recommendation algorithms in the field of machines, and this is also my field of interest.
